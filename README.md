# SecretSanta
This is me playing around with some algorithms for a better Secret Santa assignment after being frustrated with Elfster creating multiple disconnected cycles.
In particular, no two people should be gifting each other (this is strangely annoying to me) in a Secret Santa group that is larger than 2 participants - what's the fun in that?
